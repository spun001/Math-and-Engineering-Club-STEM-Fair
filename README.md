# Math-and-Engineering-Club-STEM-Fair
The Math and Engineering Club at Mt. San Antonio College hosted a STEM Fair for Debbie Boroch Day with the intentions of allowing Elementary School students to become introduced into STEM fields through the implementation of enlightening activities. Through these activities, young students get their feet wet in the world of STEM and delve into fields ranging from mechanical engineering to computer science.
